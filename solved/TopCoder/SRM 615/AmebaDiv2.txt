PROBLEM STATEMENT
Monte-Carlo is an amoeba. Amoebas can feed on gel: whenever an amoeba encounters a piece of gel that is exactly as big as the amoeba, the amoeba will consume the gel and thus double its size.

Initially, the size of Monte-Carlo was A. During its lifetime, Monte-Carlo encountered several gels and consumed the ones it could.

You are given a vector <int> X and the int A. The elements of X are the sizes of gels Monte-Carlo encountered, in chronological order. Compute and return the final size of Monte-Carlo.

DEFINITION
Class:AmebaDiv2
Method:simulate
Parameters:vector <int>, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int simulate(vector <int> X, int A)


CONSTRAINTS
-X will contain between 1 and 200 integers, inclusive.
-Each element of X will be between 1 and 1,000,000,000, inclusive.
-A will be between 1 and 1,000,000,000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{2,1,3,1,2}
1

Returns: 4


Gel #0 is bigger than Monte-Carlo, nothing happens.
Monte-Carlo consumes gel #1. Its size is now 1+1 = 2.
Gel #2 is bigger than Monte-Carlo, nothing happens.
Gel #3 is smaller than Monte-Carlo, nothing happens.
Monte-Carlo consumes gel #4. Its size is now 2+2 = 4.


1)
{1,4,9,16,25,36,49}
10

Returns: 10

The size of Monte-Carlo doesn't change.

2)
{1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,1024,2048}
1

Returns: 512



3)
{817,832,817,832,126,817,63,63,126,817,832,287,823,817,574}
63

Returns: 252
