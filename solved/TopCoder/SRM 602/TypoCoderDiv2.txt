PROBLEM STATEMENT
TypoCoder is a programming contest like TopCoder.
TypoCoder also has a rating system.
There are two types of coders in TypoCoder: brown coders and ciel coders.
A brown coder is a coder whose rating is greater than or equal to 1200.
A ciel coder is a coder whose rating is less than 1200.

Whenever a new contestant joins TypoCoder, their rating is 500.
Cat Lower joined TypoCoder and then competed in some contests.
You are given a vector <int> rating.
For each i (0-based index), rating[i] is Cat Lower's rating after he competed in (i+1) contests.

Return the number of times Cat Lower changed his color (i.e., changed from being a ciel coder to being a brown coder or back).

EXAMPLES

0)
{1000,1200,1199}

Returns: 2

After the first contest Cat Lower was still a ciel coder. After the second contest his new rating was 1200 which made him a brown coder. (This was the first color change.) After the third contest his new rating was 1199 which made him a ciel coder again. (This was the second color change.)

1)
{1500,2200,900,3000}

Returns: 3

The color changed after the first, the third and the fourth competition.

2)
{600,700,800,900,1000,1100,1199}

Returns: 0

Cat Lower wasn't a brown coder at any time in this case.

3)
{0,4000,0,4000,4000,0,0}

Returns: 4



4)
{575,1090,3271,2496,859,2708,3774,2796,1616,2552,3783,2435,1111,526,562}
