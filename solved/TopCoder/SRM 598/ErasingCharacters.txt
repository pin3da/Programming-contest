PROBLEM STATEMENT
Fox Ciel received a string as a birthday present. However, the string was too long for her, so she decided to make it shorter by erasing some characters.


The erasing process will look as follows:

Find the smallest i such that the i-th character and the (i+1)-th character of the string are same.
If there is no such i, end the process.
Remove the i-th and the (i+1)-th character of the string, and repeat from 1.



For example, if she receives "cieeilll", she will change the string as follows: "cieeilll" -> "ciilll" -> "clll" -> "cl". You are given a string s. Return the string she will get after she erases characters as described above.
