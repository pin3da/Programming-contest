PROBLEM STATEMENT

The dividing game is played as follows:
You start by taking a clean sheet of paper and writing down some positive integer.
Then you repeat the following process:
Let X be the last integer you wrote.
If X is odd, the game ends.
Otherwise, divide X by 2 and write down the result.




For example, if you start the game by writing 12 you will then write 12/2 = 6, followed by 6/2 = 3, and as 3 is odd, the game ends there.
Your paper now contains the numbers 12, 6, and 3.




Cat Taro has just played the game starting with the integer A.
Jiro has also played the game but he started with the integer B.
You are given the ints A and B.
Return the number of integers that were written both by Taro and by Jiro.
