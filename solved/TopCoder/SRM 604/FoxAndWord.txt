PROBLEM STATEMENT
One day, Fox Ciel looked at the words "tokyo" and "kyoto" and noticed an unusual property:
We can split "tokyo" into "to"+"kyo", and then swap those two parts to obtain "kyo"+"to" = "kyoto".


Formally, let S and T be two different strings.
We call the pair (S,T) interesting if there are two non-empty strings A and B such that S = A+B and T = B+A.
For example, according to this definition, if S="tokyo" and T="kyoto", then the pair (S,T) is interesting, because we can find A="to" and B="kyo".


You are given a vector <string> words.
Return the number of interesting pairs we can find among the elements of words.
Only count each pair once.
E.g., ("tokyo","kyoto") and ("kyoto","tokyo") is the same interesting pair.

DEFINITION
Class:FoxAndWord
Method:howManyPairs
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:int
Method signature:int howManyPairs(vector <string> words)


CONSTRAINTS
-words will contain between 2 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of words will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each character in each element of words will be a lowercase letter ('a'-'z').
-All the elements in words will be pairwise distinct.


EXAMPLES

0)
{"tokyo", "kyoto"}

Returns: 1

As mentioned in the problem statement, ("tokyo", "kyoto") is an interesting pair.

1)
{"aaaaa", "bbbbb"}

Returns: 0

("aaaaa", "bbbbb") is not an interesting pair.

2)
{"ababab","bababa","aaabbb"}

Returns: 1

There is one interesting pair: ("ababab","bababa").
Note that for this interesting pair there is more than one way to choose the strings A and B.

3)
{"eel", "ele", "lee"}

Returns: 3



4)
{"aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", "bbb"}

Returns: 6



5)
{"top","coder"}

Returns: 0

Different elements of words may have different lengths.
